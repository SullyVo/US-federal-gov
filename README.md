# US-federal-gov
We’re going to look at US federal government spending broken down by agency. In this assignment we’ll learn:
• The ‘group by’ model of computation
• How to process data spread over many files
The goal is to learn about the limits of data processing on a local laptop or desktop. Later, we can compare this to the performance of a remote cluster.
Data
we will transform raw text into a term document matrix. We can use this transformed data for statistical analysis, say clustering the agencies based on what they actually spend their money on.
We’ll learn about:
• text processing
• parallelism using multiple processors
Data
The data is the same as for homework 1, and is available at http://anson.ucdavis.edu/~clarkf/sta141c/ see awards.zip. Look up the meanings of the data and fields at https://www.usaspending.gov/#/.
